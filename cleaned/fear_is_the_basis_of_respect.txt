I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psychBetter Living Through
psychology and thetopic of today's short talk is fear isthe
basis ofrespect in my consultations I talked tomany different folks
from many differentwalks of life however one of therecurring themes
in my consultations isdisrespect these men struggle withfeeling disrespected disrespected
byother men and disrespected by the womenin their lives if
they're fortunateenough to have any and I often respondto this
complaint as I will do now bysharing a brief Parable
this Parablecomes from the Hindu tradition and itkind of goes
like this once upon a timea cobra lived on the
outskirts of avillage this snake had bitten severalpeople who had
subsequently died sopeople came to fear and avoid the snakeone
day a monk visited the village andthe Cobra confided in
the monk the snakecomplained monk I'm so lonely everyonehere is
afraid afraid of me they avoidme like the plague please
help me whatam I doing wrong and the monk respondedsnake
the reason why people are afraidof you is because your
bite is venomousand you're killing people if you don'tbite people
anymore you won't have thisproblem and the snake nodded and
said ohokay that makes sense I I'll stop bitingpeople yeah
and it slithered off intothe grass a week later the
snakereturned to the Monk and it lookedterrible it had a
black eye and its tailwas bent and someone had take
a chunkout of its side and the monk exclaimedsnake oh
my goodness what happened toyou and the snake replied oh
monk Ifollowed your advice I stopped bitingpeople but as soon
as people figured outthat I wasn't going to bite them
all oftheir fear turned into anger theyruthlessly attacked me and
I barelyescaped with my life I I kind of likedit
better when they just avoided me thisis much more painful
and the monkreplied oh snakeI only told you not to
bite I never toldyou not tohiss and that's the end
of the parableand this is the moral of the story
thepoint that people who struggle with thisissue of disrespect need
to understandis this it's important for people tohear youhiss if
you present yourself as so Meekand agreeable that you would
neverpossibly bite anyone under any circumances then you're going to
get it likethe snake in the second half of thestory
you might end up as everyone'spersonal Whipping Boy they'll be
angrywith other people but they'll take itout on you why
because they wouldn't beso sure that the people that they'reactually
angry with wouldn't retaliatein this way you might actually end
upabsorbing a great deal of the pain andsuffering that other
people would liketo inflict on others but are too afraidto
do sobecause of the potentialconsequences but there apparently aren'tany consequences
to treating you withanger and disrespect for whatever reasonprobably due
to your own judgments aboutanger and aggression you have decidedthat
implementing consequences is justnot a possible outcome of thisinteraction and
this is part of thereason why family relationships have thepotential
to be the most dysfunctionalrelationships on the planet peoplebelieve on
the one hand that no matterwhat they do there will
always be aplace for them in the family and on
theother hand that no matter what anotherperson does they can't
turn their backon their family and let me tell youneither
one of those beliefs is true nowbefore I go any
further if you're likingwhat you're hearing please considersending this episode

Mouth referrals like thisthat really help to make the channelgrow
you can also hit the thanks buttonand tip me in
proportion to the valueyou feel you've received from thisepisode I
really depend on your supportit helps to make all this
possible and Ireally appreciate it thankyou in any case hissing
is importantthis means that you are able and willingto communicate
under certaincircumstances that you are someone to bereckoned with there
has to be somethingin you that other people fear becausethough
we're rather squeamish to admitit fear is the basis of
respect werespect people who have the power tohurt us but
who choose not to I'll saythat again we respect people
who havethe power to hurt us but who choose notto
I discussed this more in my episodedon't be harmless that
the power to dogood has the same root as the
power toinflict harm namely power and a personwho cannot harm
like someone who has nocapacity for harm generally is notsomeone
who has the power to do muchgood and if you
can neither help norharm someone else then you areirrelevant at
best and at the mercy ofthose who can at worst
now it'simportant to keep in mind that thiscapacity to harm
doesn't necessarilyhave to be physical it can be that butit
doesn't have to be that the capacityto harm could be
Financial or relationaloremotional and it's the awareness thatsomeone has the
ability to hurt us insome way that motivates more kindly
andrespectful action relative to someonewho we feel will never retaliate
againstus this is why countries who participatein all kinds of
treaties and pacts andalliances still have armies it's notnoble words
and good intentions thatkeep people on their side of the
fenceit's guns and if if you don't have gunsyou'd better
be able to harm others insome other way like through
their moneywhich is how for example Switzerland hasmanaged to stay
neutral and Sovereigndespite centuries of War being wagedaround it so
the point is that in orderto be respected by others
others mustfear the consequences of their ownaggression and disrespect and
thisgenerally requires having some leverageover them this could look like
beingbigger and stronger or being smarter andmore cunning or enjoying
professionalsuperiority or shaping group opinion orcontrolling funding sources orpossessing another
person's heart etcetc in conjunction with the willingnessto lean on
that leverage as appropriateand in general just like an actualphysical
lever the bigger the leveragethe less you actually have to
lean on itto make people move this is why TeddyRoosevelt's
motto was to speak softlyand carry a big stick if
your stick isbig enough you don't have to raise yourvoice
or get angry or make threats orbecome aggressive and that's
becauseyour stick will speak for you to receiverespect you need
to communicate toothers that there is something in you tobe
feared this isn't sufficient toreceive respect but without meeting thiscondition
respect generally doesn'toccur and this might be why King Solomonargued
that the highest wisdom was tokeep God Commandments and to
live in thefear the fear of the Lord when people
donot fear the consequences of theiractions they behave less wisely
so evenwisdom like respect might requireappropriate fear eliminating it entirelymay
