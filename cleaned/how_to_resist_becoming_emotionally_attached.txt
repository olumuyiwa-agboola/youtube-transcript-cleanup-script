I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psychaBetter Living Through
psychology and thetopic of today's short talk is how toresist
becoming emotionally attached nowyou might be thinking Orion what are
youtalking about isn't that bad isn't thattoxic are you really
going to teach menhow to be cooler less emotional and
lessinvested in their relationships and myresponse to that would be
yeah I amthat's exactly what I'm going to dobecause there
is a time for a man to beemotionally invested in
a relationshipship and there is a time for a man
notto be emotionally invested in arelationship and what is that
time atleast the first six months of arelationship I have
talked with too manymen too many men over the years
whoseproblems stemmed from the fact that theycould not resist becoming
emotionallyattached to a particular woman beforeshe had been properly vetted
for arelationship so many difficult andproblematic situations could be avoidedentirely
if men could learn to exercisea little restraint in this
department mydudes there is a reason why buyersexpect a diligence
period before any bigpurchase like a business or a house
theydon't yet know what they're dealing withthey don't yet know
whether theparticular opportunity in front of themis actually what they
want and hope itto be and if they don't figure
that outfor the sale it's going to be theirproblem after
they hand over the moneysimilarly men should consider the firstsix
months minimum to be the diligencedating period why six months
because ittypically takes at least that long toreach the crisis
of disillusionment inwhich the projected fantasy to which youhave been
attracted is Shattered by thereality of who the other person
actuallyis and if you decide to give your heartto to
a woman before you can see who shereally is then
you're not just gamblingyou're gambling without even botheringto learn the
rules of the gamedon't do that that is stupid and
it'sstupid for two reasons in the firstplace if you decide
to emotionallyinvest in a woman who turns out to be
ofpoor moral character you're going tosuffer and you're going to
sufferbecause ultimately you will need tochoose between your head and
your heartthat is you'll have to choose betweenwhat is good
and right for you and whatyou've already chosen to love
and that'sa terrible position to be in like nomatter what
you do it's going to hurtand it might hurt real
bad and franklyyou did that to yourself because you didnot
exercise sufficient restraint anddiscernment before choosing toemotionally invest in that
particularwoman resisting this investment is anemotional survival strategy and in
thesecond place if you decide toemotionally invest in a woman
before itis warranted you will place yourself inthe adorer role
this will force her inthe place of the adored which
isgenerally not where women want to bebecause it robs them
of the emotionalexperience that women typically seekfrom romantic relationships a
man in theAdor role is also less attractivebecause if you're
looking up at her thenshe's looking down at you and
it's veryhard for a woman to love let alonerespecta man
that she is forced to look down onso emotionally investing
too soon cansignificantly compromise attraction anddrive a woman right out
of your liferemember you can't want someone intowanting you more
so just cool your jetseither way it's just not a
good idea formen to allow themselves to emotionallyinvest in any
given woman until theyconduct sufficient due diligence theymay need to
actively resist the urge todo so a lot of guys
they have a greatfirst date and they're already thinkingabout what
their kids are going to looklike or they meet a
woman who themreal good and they think wow she'sperfect I

it is your job to resist thepull to emotionally invest
in any givenwoman until it is appropriate to do sodealing
with women is a lot like playingpoker every once in
a while you're goingto be dealt some good whole cards
if youstart jumping out of your chair andchanging your bedding
Behavior everytime you get pocket aces you're notgoing to win
that pot and you haven'teven seen the Flop yet like
that's anadvantageous position to be in but youhave to put
on your best poker face inthat situation you keep a
rain on youremotions and you don't deviate from yoursystem because
that's your best bet ofactually raking in a big pot
in thatcircumstance you can not allow youremotions to change your
behavior nowthere are several things that you can doto resist
the pull to invest emotionallyfirst and foremost you need to
guardyour thoughts if she's not around don'tthink about her in
general it's not agood idea to let your mind wander
tothings that aren't present in your lifeif you do this
you will be where yourlife is not and that's not
generallywhere you want to beyou want to be where your
life isbecause at the end of the day that's allyou
really have be mindful of where yourthoughts are are you
remembering how shemoaned are you fantasizing about thenext encounter if
you spend more andmore time with the mental construct of
awoman in the privacy of your ownConsciousness you are basically
trainingyourself to fall in love with the ideaof who she
is that is unwise gentlemenbe mindful of this and redirect
yourattention to other things your work yourfriends your Fitness or
just what'sright in front of you next up if you'veonly
known yourself if you only knowneach other for a few
weeks you shouldnot be texting every day let alone allday
every day constant communicationdramatically accelerates the emotionalintimacy process I understand
that itmight be reassuring and exciting maybeeven flattering for an
attractive womanto blow up your phone however if yourespond to
everything she sends you thenshe is functionally dictating theCadence ofinteraction
this is the most common waythat men slip into a
woman's framewithout realizing it get back to herwhen you want
to get back to her she'sgoing to have whatever emotionalresponse
she's going to have that's notup to you and if
she throws a tantrumbecause you kept her waiting as opposedto
feeling grateful that you got aresponse then you just learned
avaluable piece of information didn'tyou here's another one inappropriatedisclosure some
of you guys are goingout on like 12-hour dates where
by theend of them you end up sharing yourdeepest darkest
secrets with each otherall of your previous relationship traumaand a
bridged history of your entirechildhood and your most sincere wishesfor
the future why are you doing thisyou do not yet
know who this person isyou do not yet know what
they are goinggoing to do with this information thisis like
Achilles telling some girl hejust met you know I don't
really like toadmit it but I'm a little soft aroundthe
ankles like why would he do that therule of thumb
is that if you're not yetready to trust this person
with yourbank account information then you're notget ready for this
level ofvulnerability after all that's just yourmoney you can make
more money trust mebeing robbed is easier to recover fromthan
a toxic relationship thoughobviously I'm not recommending eitherpeople make decisions
with their heartthat they would never make with theirmoney they
believe that they can justget over things as a therapist
let metell you that it is actually fairlydifficult for most
people to just getover things and getting emotionallyinvolved with the
wrong with the wrongperson is right near the top of
the listof things that are hard to just get overso
until you trust someone with yourmoney don't trust them with
your heartjust be two consenting adults who enjoyeach other's company
these three thingsmentally obsessing about someonecommunicating constantly being tooemotionally vulnerable
these threethings are how people fall in love witheach other
that's how men becomeemotionally invested now I'm not sayingto never
become emotionally invested ina woman just that you damn well
betterbe sure that that woman is safe andtrustworthy and competent
and loyalbefore you do so and if you're unwillingto take
the time to figure that outbeforehand you are just asking
for painand don't you have enough of that inyour life
as it is so get a handle onyour emotions gentlemen
