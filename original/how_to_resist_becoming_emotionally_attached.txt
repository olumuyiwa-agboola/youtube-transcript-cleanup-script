I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
0:02
Better Living Through psychology and the
0:04
topic of today's short talk is how to
0:05
resist becoming emotionally attached now
0:09
you might be thinking Orion what are you
0:10
talking about isn't that bad isn't that
0:13
toxic are you really going to teach men
0:15
how to be cooler less emotional and less
0:18
invested in their relationships and my
0:20
response to that would be yeah I am
0:23
that's exactly what I'm going to do
0:25
because there is a time for a man to be
0:28
emotionally invested in a relationship
0:30
ship and there is a time for a man not
0:32
to be emotionally invested in a
0:34
relationship and what is that time at
0:38
least the first six months of a
0:41
relationship I have talked with too many
0:44
men too many men over the years whose
0:48
problems stemmed from the fact that they
0:50
could not resist becoming emotionally
0:52
attached to a particular woman before
0:55
she had been properly vetted for a
0:58
relationship so many difficult and
1:00
problematic situations could be avoided
1:03
entirely if men could learn to exercise
1:06
a little restraint in this department my
1:09
dudes there is a reason why buyers
1:12
expect a diligence period before any big
1:15
purchase like a business or a house they
1:18
don't yet know what they're dealing with
1:20
they don't yet know whether the
1:22
particular opportunity in front of them
1:25
is actually what they want and hope it
1:27
to be and if they don't figure that out
1:29
for the sale it's going to be their
1:32
problem after they hand over the money
1:35
similarly men should consider the first
1:38
six months minimum to be the diligence
1:42
dating period why six months because it
1:45
typically takes at least that long to
1:47
reach the crisis of disillusionment in
1:50
which the projected fantasy to which you
1:52
have been attracted is Shattered by the
1:55
reality of who the other person actually
1:57
is and if you decide to give your heart
1:59
to to a woman before you can see who she
2:01
really is then you're not just gambling
2:05
you're gambling without even bothering
2:06
to learn the rules of the game
2:09
don't do that that is stupid and it's
2:11
stupid for two reasons in the first
2:14
place if you decide to emotionally
2:16
invest in a woman who turns out to be of
2:18
poor moral character you're going to
2:21
suffer and you're going to suffer
2:24
because ultimately you will need to
2:26
choose between your head and your heart
2:29
that is you'll have to choose between
2:30
what is good and right for you and what
2:32
you've already chosen to love and that's
2:36
a terrible position to be in like no
2:38
matter what you do it's going to hurt
2:40
and it might hurt real bad and frankly
2:43
you did that to yourself because you did
2:46
not exercise sufficient restraint and
2:48
discernment before choosing to
2:50
emotionally invest in that particular
2:51
woman resisting this investment is an
2:54
emotional survival strategy and in the
2:57
second place if you decide to
2:58
emotionally invest in a woman before it
3:00
is warranted you will place yourself in
3:03
the adorer role this will force her in
3:06
the place of the adored which is
3:08
generally not where women want to be
3:11
because it robs them of the emotional
3:13
experience that women typically seek
3:15
from romantic relationships a man in the
3:18
Ador role is also less attractive
3:20
because if you're looking up at her then
3:24
she's looking down at you and it's very
3:27
hard for a woman to love let alone
3:29
respect
3:30
a man that she is forced to look down on
3:33
so emotionally investing too soon can
3:35
significantly compromise attraction and
3:37
drive a woman right out of your life
3:39
remember you can't want someone into
3:42
wanting you more so just cool your jets
3:46
either way it's just not a good idea for
3:48
men to allow themselves to emotionally
3:49
invest in any given woman until they
3:52
conduct sufficient due diligence they
3:55
may need to actively resist the urge to
3:58
do so a lot of guys they have a great
4:00
first date and they're already thinking
4:02
about what their kids are going to look
4:03
like or they meet a woman who them
4:05
real good and they think wow she's
4:07
perfect I finally found the one this is
4:10
inappropriate gentlemen it's like I'm
4:12
glad you had a good time or a fun night
4:14
or two but don't get ahead of yourselves
4:16
because you are setting yourself up for
4:18
a fall now before I go any further if
4:21
you're liking what you're hearing please
4:23

4:25

4:27

4:28
like this that really help to make the
4:29
channel grow you can also hit the thanks
4:32
button and tip me in proportion to the
4:34
value you feel you've received from this
4:36
message I don't do corporate
4:37
sponsorships or product placements so
4:39
this is how I keep all of this running I
4:42
really appreciate your support thank you
4:44
very
4:45
much men it is your job to resist the
4:49
pull to emotionally invest in any given
4:52
woman until it is appropriate to do so
4:55
dealing with women is a lot like playing
4:57
poker every once in a while you're going
4:59
to be dealt some good whole cards if you
5:02
start jumping out of your chair and
5:04
changing your bedding Behavior every
5:06
time you get pocket aces you're not
5:07
going to win that pot and you haven't
5:09
even seen the Flop yet like that's an
5:12
advantageous position to be in but you
5:14
have to put on your best poker face in
5:16
that situation you keep a rain on your
5:19
emotions and you don't deviate from your
5:22
system because that's your best bet of
5:25
actually raking in a big pot in that
5:28
circumstance you can not allow your
5:30
emotions to change your behavior now
5:33
there are several things that you can do
5:35
to resist the pull to invest emotionally
5:39
first and foremost you need to guard
5:41
your thoughts if she's not around don't
5:46
think about her in general it's not a
5:49
good idea to let your mind wander to
5:51
things that aren't present in your life
5:54
if you do this you will be where your
5:56
life is not and that's not generally
5:58
where you want to be
6:00
you want to be where your life is
6:01
because at the end of the day that's all
6:03
you really have be mindful of where your
6:05
thoughts are are you remembering how she
6:08
moaned are you fantasizing about the
6:10
next encounter if you spend more and
6:13
more time with the mental construct of a
6:15
woman in the privacy of your own
6:17
Consciousness you are basically training
6:19
yourself to fall in love with the idea
6:23
of who she is that is unwise gentlemen
6:27
be mindful of this and redirect your
6:30
attention to other things your work your
6:32
friends your Fitness or just what's
6:35
right in front of you next up if you've
6:38
only known yourself if you only known
6:40
each other for a few weeks you should
6:43
not be texting every day let alone all
6:46
day every day constant communication
6:49
dramatically accelerates the emotional
6:51
intimacy process I understand that it
6:54
might be reassuring and exciting maybe
6:57
even flattering for an attractive woman
6:59
to blow up your phone however if you
7:02
respond to everything she sends you then
7:06
she is functionally dictating the
7:08
Cadence of
7:09
interaction this is the most common way
7:12
that men slip into a woman's frame
7:14
without realizing it get back to her
7:17
when you want to get back to her she's
7:19
going to have whatever emotional
7:21
response she's going to have that's not
7:23
up to you and if she throws a tantrum
7:26
because you kept her waiting as opposed
7:28
to feeling grateful that you got a
7:29
response then you just learned a
7:31
valuable piece of information didn't
7:33
you here's another one inappropriate
7:36
disclosure some of you guys are going
7:38
out on like 12-hour dates where by the
7:41
end of them you end up sharing your
7:43
deepest darkest secrets with each other
7:45
all of your previous relationship trauma
7:47
and a bridged history of your entire
7:49
childhood and your most sincere wishes
7:51
for the future why are you doing this
7:54
you do not yet know who this person is
7:57
you do not yet know what they are going
7:59
going to do with this information this
8:01
is like Achilles telling some girl he
8:04
just met you know I don't really like to
8:06
admit it but I'm a little soft around
8:07
the ankles like why would he do that the
8:11
rule of thumb is that if you're not yet
8:13
ready to trust this person with your
8:15
bank account information then you're not
8:18
get ready for this level of
8:20
vulnerability after all that's just your
8:23
money you can make more money trust me
8:26
being robbed is easier to recover from
8:29
than a toxic relationship though
8:30
obviously I'm not recommending either
8:33
people make decisions with their heart
8:35
that they would never make with their
8:36
money they believe that they can just
8:39
get over things as a therapist let me
8:42
tell you that it is actually fairly
8:44
difficult for most people to just get
8:46
over things and getting emotionally
8:48
involved with the wrong with the wrong
8:49
person is right near the top of the list
8:53
of things that are hard to just get over
8:55
so until you trust someone with your
8:57
money don't trust them with your heart
9:01
just be two consenting adults who enjoy
9:03
each other's company these three things
9:06
mentally obsessing about someone
9:08
communicating constantly being too
9:10
emotionally vulnerable these three
9:12
things are how people fall in love with
9:14
each other that's how men become
9:17
emotionally invested now I'm not saying
9:19
to never become emotionally invested in
9:21
a woman just that you damn well better
9:24
be sure that that woman is safe and
9:27
trustworthy and competent and loyal
9:30
before you do so and if you're unwilling
9:33
to take the time to figure that out
9:35
beforehand you are just asking for pain
9:39
and don't you have enough of that in
9:41
your life as it is so get a handle on
9:44
your emotions gentlemen and don't be
9:46
stupid what do you think does this fit
