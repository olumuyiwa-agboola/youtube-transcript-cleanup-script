I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
0:03
Better Living Through psychology and the
0:05
topic of today's short talk is fear is
0:08
the basis of
0:10
respect in my consultations I talked to
0:12
many different folks from many different
0:14
walks of life however one of the
0:16
recurring themes in my consultations is
0:19
disrespect these men struggle with
0:22
feeling disrespected disrespected by
0:24
other men and disrespected by the women
0:26
in their lives if they're fortunate
0:28
enough to have any and I often respond
0:30
to this complaint as I will do now by
0:32
sharing a brief Parable this Parable
0:36
comes from the Hindu tradition and it
0:38
kind of goes like this once upon a time
0:40
a cobra lived on the outskirts of a
0:43
village this snake had bitten several
0:45
people who had subsequently died so
0:48
people came to fear and avoid the snake
0:51
one day a monk visited the village and
0:53
the Cobra confided in the monk the snake
0:56
complained monk I'm so lonely everyone
0:59
here is afraid afraid of me they avoid
1:01
me like the plague please help me what
1:03
am I doing wrong and the monk responded
1:05
snake the reason why people are afraid
1:08
of you is because your bite is venomous
1:10
and you're killing people if you don't
1:12
bite people anymore you won't have this
1:14
problem and the snake nodded and said oh
1:17
okay that makes sense I I'll stop biting
1:19
people yeah and it slithered off into
1:21
the grass a week later the snake
1:24
returned to the Monk and it looked
1:26
terrible it had a black eye and its tail
1:29
was bent and someone had take a chunk
1:31
out of its side and the monk exclaimed
1:33
snake oh my goodness what happened to
1:35
you and the snake replied oh monk I
1:39
followed your advice I stopped biting
1:41
people but as soon as people figured out
1:44
that I wasn't going to bite them all of
1:46
their fear turned into anger they
1:48
ruthlessly attacked me and I barely
1:50
escaped with my life I I kind of liked
1:53
it better when they just avoided me this
1:55
is much more painful and the monk
1:58
replied oh snake
2:00
I only told you not to bite I never told
2:04
you not to
2:06
hiss and that's the end of the parable
2:09
and this is the moral of the story the
2:11
point that people who struggle with this
2:13
issue of disrespect need to understand
2:15
is this it's important for people to
2:18
hear you
2:20
hiss if you present yourself as so Meek
2:24
and agreeable that you would never
2:27
possibly bite anyone under any circum
2:30
ances then you're going to get it like
2:32
the snake in the second half of the
2:33
story you might end up as everyone's
2:35
personal Whipping Boy they'll be angry
2:38
with other people but they'll take it
2:40
out on you why because they wouldn't be
2:43
so sure that the people that they're
2:45
actually angry with wouldn't retaliate
2:49
in this way you might actually end up
2:51
absorbing a great deal of the pain and
2:53
suffering that other people would like
2:56
to inflict on others but are too afraid
2:59
to do so
3:00
because of the potential
3:02
consequences but there apparently aren't
3:04
any consequences to treating you with
3:07
anger and disrespect for whatever reason
3:10
probably due to your own judgments about
3:12
anger and aggression you have decided
3:15
that implementing consequences is just
3:17
not a possible outcome of this
3:19
interaction and this is part of the
3:21
reason why family relationships have the
3:24
potential to be the most dysfunctional
3:27
relationships on the planet people
3:30
believe on the one hand that no matter
3:32
what they do there will always be a
3:35
place for them in the family and on the
3:38
other hand that no matter what another
3:40
person does they can't turn their back
3:43
on their family and let me tell you
3:46
neither one of those beliefs is true now
3:49
before I go any further if you're liking
3:51
what you're hearing please consider
3:52
sending this episode to someone who
3:53
might benefit from its message because
3:55
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
3:56
that really help to make the channel
3:57
grow you can also hit the thanks button
4:01
and tip me in proportion to the value
4:03
you feel you've received from this
4:05
episode I really depend on your support
4:08
it helps to make all this possible and I
4:10
really appreciate it thank
4:12
you in any case hissing is important
4:17
this means that you are able and willing
4:19
to communicate under certain
4:21
circumstances that you are someone to be
4:23
reckoned with there has to be something
4:26
in you that other people fear because
4:29
though we're rather squeamish to admit
4:30
it fear is the basis of respect we
4:34
respect people who have the power to
4:36
hurt us but who choose not to I'll say
4:39
that again we respect people who have
4:41
the power to hurt us but who choose not
4:45
to I discussed this more in my episode
4:48
don't be harmless that the power to do
4:50
good has the same root as the power to
4:53
inflict harm namely power and a person
4:57
who cannot harm like someone who has no
5:00
capacity for harm generally is not
5:02
someone who has the power to do much
5:04
good and if you can neither help nor
5:07
harm someone else then you are
5:09
irrelevant at best and at the mercy of
5:12
those who can at worst now it's
5:15
important to keep in mind that this
5:17
capacity to harm doesn't necessarily
5:19
have to be physical it can be that but
5:23
it doesn't have to be that the capacity
5:25
to harm could be Financial or relational
5:29
or
5:30
emotional and it's the awareness that
5:33
someone has the ability to hurt us in
5:35
some way that motivates more kindly and
5:38
respectful action relative to someone
5:41
who we feel will never retaliate against
5:44
us this is why countries who participate
5:46
in all kinds of treaties and pacts and
5:50
alliances still have armies it's not
5:53
noble words and good intentions that
5:55
keep people on their side of the fence
5:57
it's guns and if if you don't have guns
6:00
you'd better be able to harm others in
6:02
some other way like through their money
6:05
which is how for example Switzerland has
6:07
managed to stay neutral and Sovereign
6:08
despite centuries of War being waged
6:10
around it so the point is that in order
6:13
to be respected by others others must
6:16
fear the consequences of their own
6:18
aggression and disrespect and this
6:21
generally requires having some leverage
6:23
over them this could look like being
6:26
bigger and stronger or being smarter and
6:28
more cunning or enjoying professional
6:31
superiority or shaping group opinion or
6:34
controlling funding sources or
6:37
possessing another person's heart etc
6:39
etc in conjunction with the willingness
6:42
to lean on that leverage as appropriate
6:45
and in general just like an actual
6:47
physical lever the bigger the leverage
6:50
the less you actually have to lean on it
6:52
to make people move this is why Teddy
6:55
Roosevelt's motto was to speak softly
6:58
and carry a big stick if your stick is
7:01
big enough you don't have to raise your
7:03
voice or get angry or make threats or
7:06
become aggressive and that's because
7:08
your stick will speak for you to receive
7:12
respect you need to communicate to
7:14
others that there is something in you to
7:16
be feared this isn't sufficient to
7:19
receive respect but without meeting this
7:22
condition respect generally doesn't
7:24
occur and this might be why King Solomon
7:26
argued that the highest wisdom was to
7:28
keep God Commandments and to live in the
7:31
fear the fear of the Lord when people do
7:35
not fear the consequences of their
7:36
actions they behave less wisely so even
7:41
wisdom like respect might require
7:44
appropriate fear eliminating it entirely
7:47
may not be to our benefit something to
